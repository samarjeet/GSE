# it's all about target and properties
# Targets model the components of you application. 
# An executable is a target, a library is a target. 
# Your application is built as a collection of targets that depend on and use each other.

# Targets have properties. 
# Properties of a target are the source files itï¿½s built from, the compiler options it requires, the libraries it links against. 
# In modern CMake you create a list of targets and define the necessary properties on them.
